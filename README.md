# 🦹‍♂ Marvel Landing Page.

## **Marvel API** - Landing Page.

#### 👨🏻‍💻 I am a Frontend Developer passionate about the world of the web. I enjoy testing new technologies and pushing existing ones to the limit. I am a lover of marvel and marvel comics and I have decided in this project to consume the api provided by marvel to show each of its characters and their stories.

### 🧰 For the elaboration of the project the tools are used:

- **HTML.**
- **CSS.**
- **JS (Async).**
- **NPM Deploy** (You can run the `npm run deploy` command to be able to deploy the application to my github page).
